# yt-dlp-helper
yt-dlp Helper for myself using python.
The main script is only work on UNIX system so modify it if you want to use it on Windows. (There is Windows version.)
# How to use
Put the script on folder you don't want to move, then make alias on your '.bashrc', '.zshrc', and other that you use.
# Windows version
windows version is the stripped version of the unix one and you need to install python first.
